  question: "A ship at rest will safely lie to an anchor streamed over the bow. Two anchors are normally carried, although some ships which operate in river trades or St. Lawrence Seaway also ship a stern anchor that will enable the ship to be anchored safely in a narrow channel where the re is insufficient room to swing. Anchors will normally have two “flukes”, which are blades that will dig into the sea bed and, along with the anchor chain cable, provide sufficient force to hold the vessel at rest. On a very large ship the anchor may weigh in excess of 100 tonnes. The cable itself is enormously heavy, so it is clear that the windlass capable of lifting this off the sea bottom must be an enormously powerful winch. Windlasses are typically powered by steam or electricity, geared heavily so that the maximum amount of lift is provided, with the chain grasped in a special wheel or “gypsy” that stops the chain from slipping. Once off the bottom, the windlass lifts the anchor until it is housed in its hawse pipe and secured. According to the passage, it isn’t true that:",

  question: "A coaster was on a journey in a Fjord. Early in the morning, when the ship was to change course, she collided with a small lighthouse. The reason why the collision took place is unknown. The foundation of the lighthouse was circular with a flat top just underneath the water surface. Its diameter was bigger than the diameter of the lighthouse itself, situated right on top of the foundation. This construction causes a rather sharp outer edge, which could easily rip a ship’s hull. This was what happened the ship’s hull was ripped open and she sank within minutes. Two persons on the bridge died. Two other crew members survived although they could not reach the survival suits which were kept under port bridge wing as the ship immediately listed to port and put them out of reach. One of the survivors managed to launch the starboard life raft. Another crew member was down in the mess room and threw out a couple of life jackets. He did not manage to get out of the mess room. The investigation found that the hydrostatic releases to the rafts had not been properly mounted. If the starboard side raft had not been launched manually, no raft would have been released. We cannot understand from the passage _________",
